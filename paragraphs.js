At thatperiod of the day the sunâ€™s warm rays seemed to cast a sleepy spell over the silent",
  "While setting out on a new project or a business venture, commitment is required to see the project or business venture through. Just as a personal relationship flourishes with commitment, a goal requires to be pursued with complete commitment, to realize it. Lack of commitment has led to many good ideas being frittered away only because people did not pursue them with conviction.",
  "A goal which cannot sustain your interest for a long time presents a problem because it is very difficult to retain the commitment for it. It is, therefore, important that you set your goals carefully and systematically so that you don't have to regret later. If the work is such that it itself sustains your interests, then you will enjoy doing it in-spite of the difficulties and never feel bored of it.",
  "The government of India has been taking a flurry of measures to correct the gender bias and support women. For instance Priyadarshini - a pilot programme for women empowerment, Support to Training and Employment Programme - to develop skills of women for self and employment, Udaan- to promote girl education and Sukanya Samridhi Yojana under which girl child below 10 years will have bank accounts with more interest to name a few.

  "Education and empowerment go hand in hand. If we are to empower girls, it is imperative to give women access to education. It is no coincidence that an improvement in the condition of women has coincided with an increase in the literacy rates of women to more than 50 per cent today. It is also important, at the same time, to sensitise the men of the society on gender issues so that the existing gender bias can be wiped off.",
  "Cleanliness is necessary for good health. It is the most important hygiene habit. Dirt spreads diseases, because germs thrive in it. They move about with the dust in the air, so a dirty man is easily attacked with diseases. The man, who has a clean body and puts on clean clothes, is free from dirt and dust, and no disease can attack him easily. Daily bathing is a good habit. It keeps our body clean. We should keep our clothes, beddings, food, utensils, and all other things neat and clean. No dirt should be allowed to gather near our houses. We should also keep our teeth and nails clean. We should remember that cleanliness is next to godliness.",
  "The proverb says that health is wealth. It is truly said that of all things in the world health is the most valuable that one can possess. Money is no doubt a pleasant thing.
